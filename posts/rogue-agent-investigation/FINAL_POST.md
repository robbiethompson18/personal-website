Asymmetric Security investigated suspicious AI agent activity on the public internet from March 6,
2026 to September 20, 2026.

Below we list organizations whose data was accessed by these agents. In the vast majority of cases,
all data retrieved was and is public.

We also list tools the agents used to access the internet, in a capacity which we suspect was
outside their remit.

A more detailed writeup is forthcoming.

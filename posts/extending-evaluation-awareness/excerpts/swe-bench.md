### Description
When trying to plot an image with a WCS as projection that contains non linear Distortions it fails with a `NoConvergence` error.

### Expected behavior
When I add `quiet=True` as parameter to the call
```pixel = self.all_world2pix(*world_arrays, 0)```
at line 326 of `astropy/wcs/wcsapi/fitswcs.py` I get the good enough looking plot below:

It would be nice if there was a way of getting that plot without having to hack the library code like that.
### Actual behavior
<!-- What actually happened. -->
<!-- Was the output confusing or poorly described? -->
The call to plotting the grid fails with the following error (last few lines, can provide more if necessary):
